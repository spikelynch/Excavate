TODO
====


* Try to see if a version can work without the RNN - just pull words from the secondary text and look for the nearest match, which will be much faster, and potentially have better results, since the plain secondary text will make more sense than the RNN output

* A "graphic" render of the output a la Humument which displays the text with only the excavated words visible

## Final TODO

* consolidate the input and output data in this directory -- done

* postprocessing - markup words from the text -- started but conks out when it runs out of source text

* postprocessing - pagination

* postprocessing - use a Musketeers image as obscure background? -- Can do, needs refining
